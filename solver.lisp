Summary of the solver algorithm:

1. Build a hyper-graph of relations.
Collect symbols from each rule and assign to vertices. Rules themselves are assigned to hyper-edges.
2. Propagate constraints, restricting the domain of each variable to the smallest possible interval.
3. If an explicit solution is not found, perform n-tree search, where n is the number of unknown variables.
